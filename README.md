# -CPU-scheduling-Algorithm-Simulation-GUI
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) based simulator for various CPU scheduling algorithms. It helps visualize and compare different scheduling techniques, providing insights into process execution, waiting time, turnaround time, and efficiency
 Multiple Scheduling Algorithms ‚Äì Supports FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, etc.
‚úÖ Interactive GUI ‚Äì User-friendly interface for inputting processes and visualizing execution order.
‚úÖ Gantt Chart Visualization ‚Äì Displays the scheduling sequence graphically.
‚úÖ Performance Metrics ‚Äì Calculates waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.
‚úÖ Customizable Input ‚Äì Allows users to enter process details like burst time, arrival time, and priority.
